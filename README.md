# Reverberation-Maze-Escape

Final Project for CS448 Audio Computing Labatory at UIUC where I designed a maze escape simulator in Python where you rely on sound reverberation time rather than your eyes to navigate your way to the exit. Built my project on the basis of echolocation- bat's ability to measure their surroundings via sound waves.
